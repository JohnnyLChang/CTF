       chip8 file formats

       The _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n program understands	3 file formats:	raw, HP	and #!.	 The
       only difference is the headers.	All 3 formats have a header, followed
       by data.	 The data will be at most 3584 bytes long.

       The raw format has no header.  There is only the	data section in	the
       file.

HHPP FFOORRMMAATT
       the HP format has a 13 byte header in the format
	      8-bytes	      magic number "HPHP48-A"
			      48,50,48,50,34,38	(hex)
	      2.5-bytes	      type
			      0x02C2A for "string"
	      2.5-bytes	      length
			      in nybbles, including length.

       The 2.5 byte fields are encodes as big-endian nybbles.

       The #! format discards all bytes	upto the first newline ('\n') charac-
       ter, this is useful to make chip8 programs self-executing, by making
       the first line
	      #! /usr/local/bin/chip8run -
       Which tells unix	to invoke the _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n(1) program and feed it the exe-
       cuting file on its standard input.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
       _c_h_i_p_8_a_s(1)
	       An assembler, for assembling chip8 programs into	the byte-code
	       to be interpreted.

       _c_h_i_p_8_a_s(5)
	       The opcodes, as understood by the assmbler, and how they	are
	       interpreted by the interpreter.

       _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n(1)
	       The interpreter,	to run the assembled byte code.

       _c_h_i_p_8_d_i_s(1)
	       A disassembler, so that you can turn assembled byte code	into
	       something more readable.
