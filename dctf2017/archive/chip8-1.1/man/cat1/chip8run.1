DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n program is used to run chip8 programs.  It is an X11
       client.

       The first form, where only the name of a	game is	given, constructs a
       filename	of the form /usr/local/lib/chip8/_g_a_m_e.chp and attempts to open
       it.

       The second form may be used to open a specific file.

       A great variety of file formats are understood, including some of the
       HP48 formats, and also the UNIX executable #! convention.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The following options are understood.

       --HHeellpp   This option may be used to provide information about how	to use
	       the _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n program.

	       This option may be used to provide inforation about the version
	       on the _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n program being executed.

       --BBaacckkGGrroouunndd _c_o_l_o_r
	       This option may be used to set the backgound of the _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n
	       window to the color specified.

	       This option may be used to set the border color of the _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n
	       window to the color specified.

	       This option may be used to set the border width of the _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n
	       window to the width specified.

       --DDEEbbuugg  This option may be used to turn on debugging mode.  Additional
	       information is displayed	as to the chip8	machine's internal
	       state.  Addition	buttons	are provided for additional control.

       --DDiissppllaayy	_d_i_s_p_l_a_y_-_n_a_m_e
	       This option may be used to set which X display to use.  The
	       default is the _$_D_I_S_P_L_A_Y environment variable, or	::00 if not set.

       --FFooNNtt _f_o_n_t_-_n_a_m_e
	       This option may be used to set the font to be used in the
	       _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n	window.

       --FFoorreeGGrroouunndd _c_o_l_o_r
	       This option may be used to set the foregound of the _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n
	       window to the color specified.

       --GGeeoommeettrryy _g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y_-_s_p_e_c
	       This option may be used to specifiy the initial position	and/or
	       size of the _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n window.

       --IICCoonniicc This option may be used to specify that the _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n window
	       should initially	be iconic.  You	need a cooperative window man-
	       agaer.

       --IIccoonn__GGeeoommeettrryy _g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y_-_s_p_e_c
	       This option may be used to specify the position and/or size of
	       the _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n window's icon.

       --NNaammee _s_t_r_i_n_g
	       This option may be used to set the name the _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n window is
	       referred	to as.

       --TTeesstt__MMooddee
	       This option may be used to test the chip8 machine.  It makes
	       the "Quit" button generate and exit code	of 1, rather than 0
	       (it is an error if the user quits out of	a test).  It makes
	       screen placement	forced.	 Run-time errors result	in exit	1,
	       rather than turning on debugging.

       --TTiittllee _s_t_r_i_n_g
	       This option may be used to set the name the _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n window is

       --XXRRMM _s_t_r_i_n_g
	       This option may be used to specify an X resource.

       All options are case-insensitive.  Abbreviations	are indicated by the
       upper-case letters.  Options and	other command line arguments may be

       The _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n command will exit with a status of 1 on any	error.	The
       _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n	command	will only exit with a status of	0 if there are no
       errors.

FFIILLEESS
       /usr/local/lib/chip8
	       This directory is where games are installed.  A number of games
	       are included in this distribution.

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
       _c_h_i_p_8_a_s(1)
	       An assembler, for assembling chip8 programs into	the byte-code
	       to be interpreted.

       _c_h_i_p_8_a_s(5)
	       The opcodes, as understood by the assmbler, and how they	are
	       interpreted by the interpreter.

       _c_h_i_p_8_r_u_n(5)
	       The file	format,	as output by the assembler and as understood
	       by the interpreter.

       _c_h_i_p_8_d_i_s(1)
	       A disassembler, so that you can turn assembled byte code	into
	       something more readable.
