.SH DESCRIPTION
OK folks here it is!
Pong for the Chip8.
.PP
The game never ends.  It keeps score, but only up to 9 for each player,
then it will roll over to 0.  Sorry, it's the only way I could think of
to do it.  So, you have to play ``whoever gets to a number first, wins.''
.PP
It is kind of slow, but then there are two paddles and ball
moving around all at once.
.PP
The player who got the last point gets the serve...
