	Copyright (C) 1990, 1991, 1998,	1999, 2012 Peter Miller

	License.  See the LICENSE section, below, for more details.

DESCRIPTION
	Chip8 was an interpreter used in a number of home computers based on
	RCA's CDP1802 processor	in the late 1970's.  It	implements a small
	machine	designed specifically for simple video games.  It has less
	than 40	instructions, including	arithmetic, control flow, graphics,
	and sound.

	This package includes an assembler for chip8, a	disassembler, and an X
	client to run chip8 programs.  This distribution includes 33 games:
	15puzzle, alien, ant, blinky, blitz, brix, car,	connect4, field,
	guess, hidden, hpiper, invaders, joust,	kaleid,	maze, merlin, missile,
	pong, puzzle, race, snake, spacefight, syzygy, tank, tetris, tictac,
	uboat, ufo, vbrix, vers, wipeoff, worm3.

	The assembler understood by this package differs from the assembler
	originaly documented for CHIP-8.  This is for a	number of reasons...
	(a) the	original was unpleasant	to write a lexer for, (b) the opcodes
	were not very orthogonal in appearance,	(c) the	format made arbitrary
	expression syntax have to tiptoe all around it,	(d) if I changed it I
	could re-use code from another of my assemblers.
